> The only way to get better at building websites is ‚Äì well, by building websites.

In March 2018 I decided to take on yet another challenge ‚Äì #30days30sites. It's a 30 day long email challenge, the sequence of events is fairly simple:

üí° Prompt   -¬ª   üîß Build   -¬ª   üåê Share

From the moment you sign up, you'll get an email every weekday with a prompt. Every email provides some additional links & some rules. Then it's up to you to build a site.

My goal is to build fairly decent websites, one for each prompt, within a day. It doesn't have to be done on 30 consecutive days. How long it will take me that day is absolutely up to me. But I will share the time, that went into the building for each of the websites.
